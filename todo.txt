Things to implement:
 - parse notes for included tags
 - filtering list by tag
 - filter list by tags
 - link to specific notes
 - timestamp on hover
 - beginning note instructions on first load

Design:
 - rounded rectangles outlining each tag
 - color scheme

Things to think about:
 - long tags need to be scrollable to the side but not disrupt divs
 - how to differentiate between starting with a tag and searching for one when making new note
 - how to best visualize editing an existing note
 - how to best add/delete a tag to an existing note
 - how to best showcase a specific note and provide extra functionality for it
 - how to best specify and/or relationships for filtering by multiple tags
 - if it's ironic whether I have this .txt note for my note managing webapp
