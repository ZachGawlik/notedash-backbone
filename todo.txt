Things to implement:
 - add/remove tags when editing
 - link to specific notes
 - timestamp on hover
 - search multiple tags at once
 - turn pastes when editing into plaintext

Design:
 - color scheme

Things to think about:
 - long tags need to be scrollable to the side but not disrupt divs
 - how to differentiate between starting with a tag and searching for one when making new note
 - how to best visualize editing an existing note
 - how to best add/delete a tag to an existing note
 - how to best showcase a specific note and provide extra functionality for it
 - how to best specify and/or relationships for filtering by multiple tags
 - if it's ironic whether I have this .txt note for my note managing webapp
 - best way to escape out of filter by a tag

Not obvious features:
- shift enter for line break in note
- searching by tag in general
- ability to start a note with a tag
