Consider:
 - Either switching to Angular or incorporating Marionette

Things to implement:
 - escape out of all edits if typing a brand new note up top
 - add/remove tags when editing
 - link to specific notes
 - timestamp on hover
 - search multiple tags at once

Design:
 - color scheme

Things to think about:
 - how to best visualize editing an existing note
 - how to best add/delete a tag to an existing note
 - how to best showcase a specific note and provide extra functionality for it
 - how to best specify AND, OR relationships for filtering by multiple tags

Not obvious features:
- shift enter for line break in note
- searching by tag in general
- ability to start a note with a tag
